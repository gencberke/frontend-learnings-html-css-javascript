        <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
        <p>
            <mark> <!-- look up -->
                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br>
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br>
            It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br>
            remaining essentially unchanged.It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing<br>
            Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker<br>
            including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</mark></p>

        <h3>Why do we use it?</h3>
        <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.<br>
            The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,<br>
            content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum<br>
            as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various<br>
            versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose <sub> <!-- look up -->
